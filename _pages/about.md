I am a second-year Machine Learning PhD in Georgia Tech, working with [Dr. Evangelos Theodorou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&hl=en) in [Autonomous Control and Decision Systems (ACDS)](https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/) Lab.
My research aims to answer <i><u>how the dynamical system perspectives can provide a new paradigm connecting <strong>Deep Learning</strong> to modern <strong>Optimal Control theory</strong></u></i>,
where the latter includes a broad methodologies <em>e.g.</em> trajectory optimization, and stochastic processes, second-order methods, and etc.
We believe this principle has the potential to alleviates the current ad-hock design process
for principled algorithmic design, characterization of the learning process, and even direct architectures optimization.


I finished my M.S. in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Dr. George Kantor on off-road autonomous navigation and deep reinforcement learning. I also owned a B.S. in MechE at National Taiwan University, with an one-year research exchange at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

I am very fortunate to work in Uber Advanced Technology Group as a Robotics Autonomy Engineer before joining Georgia Tech, developing motion planning and trajectory optimization algorithm for self-driving vehicles.
