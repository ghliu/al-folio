Hi, I am Guan-Horng Liu (I go by <b><i>&quot;Guan&quot;</i></b> ), a second-year Machine Learning PhD in Georgia Tech, advised by
<!-- [Dr. Evangelos Theodorou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&hl=en)  -->
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Evangelos Theodorou</a>
in
<a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/" target="_blank">Autonomous Control and Decision Systems (ACDS)</a>
Lab.
My research aims to answer
<u>
    how the dynamical system perspective can provide a new paradigm connecting
    <strong>Deep Learning</strong> to
    <strong>Optimal Control theory</strong></u>,
where the latter includes a broad methodologies, <i>e.g.</i> stochastic process, game theory, classical mechanics, and information duality.
We believe this principle has the potential to alleviates the current ad-hoc design process of training deep nets,
allowing principled algorithmic design, better characterization of the training, and even direct architecture optimization.


I finished my M.S. in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Dr. George Kantor on off-road autonomous navigation and deep reinforcement learning. I also owned a B.S. in MechE at National Taiwan University, with an one-year research exchange at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

I am very fortunate to work in Uber Advanced Technology Group as a Robotics Autonomy Engineer before joining Georgia Tech, developing motion planning and trajectory optimization algorithm for self-driving vehicles.
