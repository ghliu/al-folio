I am a first-year ML
<!-- <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu/" target="\_blank">ML</a> -->
PhD student in Georgia Institute of Technology working with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="\_blank">Evangelos A. Theodorou</a> in <a href="http://pwp.gatech.edu/acds/" target="\_blank">ACDS Lab</a>.
My research interest lies at the intersection of deep learning and optimal control. Particularly, how to enhance the development of deep learning both theoretically and algorithmically from the perspective of optimal control theory, trajectory optimization, and stochastic processes.
<!-- broadly under <b>Robot Learning and Control</b>. Specifically, I have researched on Deep (Inverse) Reinforcement Learning, Stochastic Optimal Control, and combing XXX -->

<!-- Before joining Georgia Tech,  -->
I finished my M.S. in Robotics at
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="\_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, working with Mr.
<a href="http://ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/george-a-kantor/" target="\_blank">George Kantor</a> on
off-road autonomous navigation and deep reinforcement learning.
I also owned a B.S. in MechE at
<a href="http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html" target="\_blank">National Taiwan University,</a> with an one-year research exchange at
<a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/" target="\_blank">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>.
<!-- My research here relates to off-road autonomous navigation for all-terrain vehicle application. Specifically, I worked on deep reinforcement learning, deep imitation learning, and model-predictive planning as my master thesis.  -->

I am very fortunate to work in
<a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/" target="\_blank">Uber Advanced Technology Group</a> as a Robotics Autonomy Engineer before joining Georgia Tech,
<!-- from Sep. 2017 to Dec. 2018 -->
developing motion planning and trajectory optimization algorithm for self-driving vehicles.
